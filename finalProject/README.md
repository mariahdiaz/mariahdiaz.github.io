# Our Ever-Growing World
## Overview
 This project is intended to increase understanding of population growth throughout the world. 
 It is easy to get consumed in daily life, thus it is important to reflect on how populated the world actually is. 
 Being aware of our population growth also helps gain a broader sense of self-awareness and, specifically, the immense impact humans have on the world. 
 The project utilized D3.js and HTML/CSS to implement each visualization and the overall website.

 
 ## Project Objectives
 1. View the distribution of population size throughout the world 
 2. View change in population trends over time 
 3. Visualize a country's population density in relation to its geographic size
 4. Get a better understanding of which countries are the most populated
